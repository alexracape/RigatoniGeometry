# Geometry Tools

This library extends the functionality of the rigatoni library by helping with creation of geometry objects and mesh entities. This library also provides the ability to import meshes from other software. This library has been abstracted away from the rigatoni library in order to reduce the amount of heavy-weight dependencies.
